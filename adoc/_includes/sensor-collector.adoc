== Sensor and Collector - TI 15.4-Stack Project Zero

To familiarize myself with the sensor and collector hardware,
I follow the lab exercise {r11}. I use _GTKTerm_ from the Mint/Ubuntu distribution.

I use two {r12} LaunchPads:

=== Copy the example projects

I import the following projects into the CCS workspace as described in the
SimpleLink CC13x2 26x2 SDK (3.40.00.02) documentation of the <<r13>>

. sensor_CC1352P1_LAUNCHXL_tirtos_ccs_syscfg
. collector_CC1352P1_LAUNCHXL_tirtos_ccs_syscfg
. coprocessor_CC1352P1_LAUNCHXL_tirtos_ccs_syscfg

Within CCS, I then copy the projects into {r0}, with the following abbreviated names:

. sensor
. collector
. coprocessor



=== Task 1

I can't set the Sub-1 Ghz Frequency to 868 Mhz as I expected,
the only choice for the european band seems to be 863 Mhz. This might be related
to the channel selection, I need to read <<r11>>.

=== Task 3

I set the serial numbers of the sensor and collector to _1_ and _2_. Therefore, I can open terminal sessions on port `/dev/ti100` and `/dev/ti200`.

As mentioned in step 6 of the lab exercise, I press and hold `Button 2` and then the `Reset` button (while Button 2 is held down) on either board, see <<hardware>>.

After pressing `Button 2` again on the collector, the sensor is allowed to join and a network is created:
