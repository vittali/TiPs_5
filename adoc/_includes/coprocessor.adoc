== Coprocessor


=== Copy the example project

I import the project `coprocessor_CC1352P1_LAUNCHXL_tirtos_ccs_syscfg` into the CCS workspace.

Within CCS, I then copy the project as `coprocessor-uart` into the {r0}.

=== UART configuration

According to the TI Design, I need to modifiy the UART configuration:

[quote, 3.2.1.1.4.3 Compiling the Mac-CoP fromSource]
____
When re-compiling the Mac CoP firmware, the pin configuration for the UART needs to be modified since the default Mac CoP example
in the CC13xxSDK uses IOID3 and IOID2 pins for UART and the gateway uses IOID11 and IOID9.
____


However, the CC1352P1 LaunchPad uses DIO12 and DIO13 corresponding to J4/J3 on the {r21}, just like the CC3220 LaunchPad for the gateway.
No modification is required on either board, other than the Jumper adjustements explained in _3.2.1.1.5 Connecting the MAC-CoP and the CC3220SFLaunchPadâ„¢_.
