== Gateway

To familiarize myself with the gateway hardware {r52}, I follow the lab exercise {r51}.

=== Task 1

I could not complete this task with the LaunchPad as shipped.

I first followed {r54} to flash the latest service pack and the MCU binary `network_terminal_CC3220SF_LAUNCHXL_tirtos_ccs`.

.Terminal output for the network terminal demo.

I then flashed the `out_of_box_CC3220SF_LAUNCHXL_tirtos_ccs` demo project as described.

The default target configuration is correct (I set the serial number for the gateway LaunchPad to _3_):

[[target-conf]]

While I was able to start a debug session for the `out_of_box_CC3220SF_LAUNCHXL_tirtos_ccs` project,
the loaded program was not persisted to flash, rather the previsiouly flashed network terminal demo would run upon reset.
Also, I did not get any terminal output, so there seems to be a difference between
the binaries I flashed in Task 1 and the one I created with CCS.


=== Task 6

I was unable to provision the LaunchPad with the android app: the scan for devices to configure always times out.
Instead, I created a profile from the website running on the LaunchPad.

Upon reset, the board connects automatically to the AP `APSchuppen`:

[[auto-connect-ap]]
.Provisioning via internal webserver seems to be succesfull.

=== Recompiling from source

I import the example projects

 15_4_Stack_Gtway_IBM_CC3220SF_LAUNCHXL_tirtos_ccs
 tirtos_builds_CC3220SF_LAUNCHXL_release_ccs

from

 vittali.ch-5-TIR-1002/tidc01002/examples/cc3220sf_gateway_app

where `vittali.ch-5-TIR-1002` is the {r0} and `tidc01002` the source code repo of the TI Design (used as a git submodule).
I then copied these projects to

 gateway
 gateway-base

in the companion repo.

The project won't compile because of issues with virtual folders and paths.
Also, the following header files are missing <<e2e3>>:

|missing file in TI Design | replacement | comment

|ti/drivers/i2s/I2SCC32XXDMA.h | I2CC32XX.h | renamed

|ti/drivers/net/wifi/bsd/sys/socket.h | ti/net/bsd/sys/socket.h |

|ti/drivers/SDSPI.h | - | no longer supported, can be removed

|wolfssl/ssl.h | wolfssl/ssl.h |  seperate https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/releases[installation]

|===


In turns out that this is just the tip of the iceberg, a lot of changes are required to get the project to compile.
Unfortunately, I still get plenty of linking errors and I am not able to build the project.
The companion repo contains the current unfinished state of the project.
