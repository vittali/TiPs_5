== IBM cloud demo software

After a couple of modifications inside the `ibm_cloud_application` directory (see log of the git submodule), I am able to
push the application to the IBM cloud:

----
$ cd vittali.ch-5-TIR-1002/tidc01002/examples/ibm_cloud_application
$ ibmcloud login
$ ibmclound target --cf
$ ibmcloud push --cf
----

I am unable to open the network as explained in Figure 67 of the reference document <<e2e2>>.

I suspect the reason is a communication problem between coprocessor and gateway or/and the coprocessor and the sensor. Clearly, the coprocessor
must be configured to use the european 863 Mhz band, but it is not clear to me how this configuration can be performed.
