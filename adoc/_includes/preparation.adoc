== Preparation

I summarize a couple of steps that helped me to streamline the development and testing workflow.
I also present a couple of error messages, some of which I am unable to reproduce, that occurred when I tried to flash a binary to the MCU during a CCS debug session.
I believe that having seen the error message in this memo up front, it becomes less frightening when it shows up in the IDE.

=== The companion repo

While one part of the source code of the TI Design is now in the official SKD <<r12>>,
the other part involving the gateway and the cloud/web front ent must be obtained from the https://git.ti.com/cgit/tidc01002/tidc01002[tidc01003 git repo] hosted by TI.
Since I am likely to make changes to the TI repo, it is useful to add it to the {r0} of this memo as a git submodule:

----
$ git submodule add https://git.ti.com/git/tidc01002/tidc01002.git
$ git submodule update --init
$ git remote rename origin ti
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:vittali/vittali.ch-5-TIR-1002-tidc01002.git
----

I can then clone the submodule:

----
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://git.ti.com/git/tidc01002/tidc01002.git
----

I then need to checkout a branch *before I make changes*:

----
$ cd tidc01002
$ git checkout master
<make changes>
$ git add .
$ git commit -m"my changes"
$ git push origin master
----


=== Disambiguating LaunchPads

Since at least two LaunchPads are connected simultaneously, I must ensure that:

. when programming a LaunchPad with CCS, the flash utility knows which LaunchPad is supposed to receive the binary,
. when testing the application components, the user knows which serial port corresponds to each LaunchPad in order to be able to open a terminal session.

==== Setting a unique serial number for each LaunchPad.

The first step is to give each LaunchPad{blank}footnote:[more precisely, the debug probe included on the LaunchPad]
a unique serial number.

I first label the LaunchPad board (see <<hardware>>) with the desired unique serial number (a non negative integer).
I then connect the LaunchPad (and only this one) to the host and use the `xdsdfu` utility{blank}footnote:[part of the CCS installation]
to write the choosen number to the LaunchPad. Here is an example session:

----
cd $CCS_INSTALLDIR/ccs/ccs_base/common/uscif/xds110
$ ./xdsdfu -e  <1>

----
<1> enumerate (list) all currently connected devices. Only one device must be connected at this time.
<2> set the device into DFU mode (required)
<3> set the serial number to _1_ (replacing _6_) and reset the device

The new serial number is persistently stored.

==== Targeting a serial number in a CCS project

Each CCS contains a target configuration file with the extension `*.ccxml`.

The connection properties page needs to be populated with the serial number of the target LaunchPad:

[[targetconf, target configuration]]
.Both target configurations are populated with the choosen serial numbers (shown is the collector project).

=== Controlling serial port enumeration

After the installation of CCS, a driver installation script must be run to complete the installation.
Under linux, the script `$CCS_HOME/ccs/ccs_base/common/uscif/install/ti_permissions_install.sh` will install the
udev{blank}footnote:[udev is the Linux subsystem for managing driver events] rules file `71-ti-permissions.rules` under
`/etc/udev/rules.d`.

When I connect a LaunchPad to the host via USB, `udev` will load the required driver and allocate two port names, for example `ttyACM0` and `ttyACM1`.
The first one is the one I need to choose in my terminal host program.

A second LaunchPad will then enumerate for example as `ttyACM2` and `ttyACM3`.

If I disconnect/reconnect a LaunchPad - something that happens during development work - a new the port name will be assigned.
Since the old port name is still available, I might be tempted to resuse it in my terminal application. This results in an an error message.
This is extremely annoying as I am forced to discover the new port name by trial and error.
It also prevents me from using default configurations for my terminal program.

A couple of hints on how to solve this problems can be found here <<r41>>, <<r42>>, <<r43>>

Here is my rules file:

:sourcedir:  /home/p/repo/sysadmin/setup/conf

[source,bash]
----
include::{sourcedir}//99-my-usb-serial.rules[]
----

The combination of properties `ID_SERIAL_SHORT` and `ID_USB_INTERFACE_NUM` is a unique key for each serial channel.
The first property is the serial number I set at the beginning of this chapter.

The last rule will enumerate the first channel on a LaunchPad with serial number 5 as `dev/ti500`, the second channel as `dev/ti503`.
Currently, I don't know if the second channel is of any importance to the user.

Here is an example where two LaunchPads with serial numbers _2_ and _6_ are connected to the host:

----
$ ls /dev/ti*
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  7 Apr 15 21:43 /dev/ti -> hidraw4
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 15 Apr 15 21:43 /dev/ti2 -> bus/usb/002/025
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  7 Apr 15 21:43 /dev/ti200 -> ttyACM2
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  7 Apr 15 21:43 /dev/ti203 -> ttyACM3
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 15 Apr 15 19:39 /dev/ti6 -> bus/usb/002/024
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  7 Apr 15 19:39 /dev/ti600 -> ttyACM0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  7 Apr 15 19:39 /dev/ti603 -> ttyACM1
----

I used the following commands to write these rules:

----
$ udevadm info -a /dev/ttyACMx
$ udevadm test /sys/class/tty/ttyACMx
----

=== Connection problems

In no particular order a grab bag of problems I encountered.

==== Force-clearing the flash

On one occasion, the collector binary flashed to the LaunchPad produced scrambled output on the terminal connection.
I reflashed, recompiled the program, to no avail. I then used UniFlash to clear the entire flash and this solved the problem:

==== Error connecting to the target: (Error -260 @ 0x0)
When I try to run the first debug session for the `network_terminal_CC3220SF_LAUNCHXL_tirtos_ccs` project from CCS , I got this:

[[error1, connection error]]
.Error message when opening a debug session to the CC3220SF LaunchPad.
image::CC3220SF-debug-error.png[error message]

I am not sure what finally allowed me to connect, but I suppose I needed to unpluck/repluck the micro USB connector.
Presumably, the Uniflash application that I used to flash the binaries still kept a connection to the board.
I did not need to change jumper positions on the board.

==== Debug Configuration: Auto Run and Launch Options

I encountered different error messages (that I failed to write down), when the option

 Connect to target on debugger startup

is not checked in the Debug Configuration.

=== Other problems

I had to deactivate Remote System Explorer Operation to speed up compilation, see <<e2e4>>
