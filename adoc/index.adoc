[abstract]

I want to connect wireless sensor nodes to the IBM IoT Watson cloud infrastructure {r1} based on the TI Design {r2}.
The reference document is {r3}. Related source code can be cloned from the {r0}. I use Linux Mint 19.2 Tina and Code Composer Studio 9.2.0 (CCS).

The software architecture described in the TI Design is now part of the official {r4} documentation and I will follow the recommended learning path of the
 _SimpleLink Academy (3.30.03.00)_. However the TI Design has more details and is still a useful resource for understanding the TI 15.4 example projects.
 More importantly, part of the software - the gateway project - is not available in the SDK and must be cloned from a git repository hosted by TI.


== Introduction

The proposed architecture for connecting wireless sensors to the Internet is based on the following components:

. one or more sensors
. a collector that manages and interacts with sensors
. a coprocessor that combines the collector function with a host communication interface
. a gateway that relays data between an internet-based application like a webserver
. a cloud service that allows for two way commmunication between an internet user and a set of sensors/actuators

The reference document <<r31>>, called _TI Design_ in this memo, contains a detailed description of each component.

So why this memo when there is a comprehensive document by TI ?

The TI Design

. tries to minimize the T.T.H.W ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9Xt6Me3mJ4&t=4104s[Time To Hello World]) by flashing prebuilt binaries
. covers two alternative cloud services, Bluemix (IBM) and (AWS) Amazon, including details on how to create a cloud-enabled account
. presents alternative apps for Android and iOS to configure the gateway part


Whereas in this memo, I

. proceed in small steps with verifiable results in order to gain at least a superficial understanding of each component
. focus on IBM bluemix without going into details, which are the subject of a previous https://www.vittali.ch/2-nred-bluemix[memo]
. do not mention any apps, since I could not get them to work as advertised (on Android)
. compile everything from source, rather than using prebuilt binaries
. adapt my host development environment to a workflow where several LaunchPads are connected to the host computer simultaneously
. summarize a couple of speed bumpers which increased the T.T.H.W

Again, the T.T.H.W. is still unknown because I am currently unable to build the gateway application from source <<e2e3>>.
